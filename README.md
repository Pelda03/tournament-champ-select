# tournament-champ-select
Random tournament champ select

Displays 20 random champions with no duplicates

A program with tkinter GUI made for unofficial ARAM tournaments that selects 20 random champions from a .csv file and displays their "tier" that you can fill in.

This program also has a functionality of updating tiers for each champion directly via the GUI in root window.

The second (app.py) has no tier functionality, but does the job of selecting 20 champs.
